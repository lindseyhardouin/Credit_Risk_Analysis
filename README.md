## Technologies

This project leverages python 3.7. It utilizes the following packages:

**[Pandas Library Python](https://pandas.pydata.org/)** - a fast, powerful, flexible and easy to use open source data analysis and manipulation tool.<br>

**[Numpy Library Python](https://numpy.org/)** -  comprehensive mathematical functions.<br>

**[scikit-learn Python](https://scikit-learn.org/)** - simple and efficient tools for predictive data analysis.<br>

**[imbalanced-learn Python](https://imbalanced-learn.org/)** - an open source, MIT-licensed library relying on scikit-learn (imported as sklearn) and provides tools when dealing with classification with imbalanced classes.<br>
